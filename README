Plugin structure:

  * Look at src/apps_streaming.erl
  * You should define and export functions, that will be available to flash. Format is  FunctionName(AMF, State). Reply is State.
  * To handle events to client runloop, add 'WAIT_FOR_DATA'(Message, State) function, which should respond in the same way as OTP handler.
