erlyvideo is a flash streaming server, written in erlang.

currently it can:

  * stream flv files (no seek yet)
  * stream mp4 files with seek, pause and resume
  * provide push channel to flash, just like juggernaut, just like AMQP
  * stream RTMPT (via embedded http server)
  * record flv from camera
  
possibly it can:

  * broadcast flv between people
  
future plans:
  * have possibility to auth users via Rails-like sessions
  * try to change quality on fly


What you can do right now?

  * use it for streaming flv and mp4 files
  * use it like juggernaut

What can you help with, if wish to try/learn Erlang
  * implement seek in flv files
